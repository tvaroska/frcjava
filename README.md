## Git Workflow

Each tag is a git branch and tag:

```bash
# Tag your current work
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Tag 1: drive"
git tag -a drive -m "Tag 1: Basic swerve drivetrain"

# Start next tag
git checkout -b basic-vision
# ... work on Tag 2 ...
git commit -m "Complete Tag 2: basic vision"
git tag -a basic-vision -m "Tag 2: Basic vision with AprilTag driving"

# Continue pattern for each tag
```

This allows you to:
- Return to any learning stage
- Compare implementations
- Share specific tags with teammates

## Troubleshooting

**Build Errors:**

2. **Experiment** - Try variations beyond the plan
3. **Test thoroughly** - Don't skip validation steps
4. **Teach others** - Best way to solidify learning

## Next Steps

Ready to start **Tag 4: simple-mechanism**?

1. Review Tag 4 details in `/home/boris/robotics/plan.md`
2. Add intake subsystem to RobotA (SparkMax motor)
3. Add flywheel subsystem to RobotB (TalonFX motor)
4. Configure motor safety and current limits
5. Bind controls to operator buttons
6. Add telemetry for mechanism states

**What to expect:**
- Learn REV SparkMax and CTRE TalonFX motor APIs
- Understand open-loop motor control
- Practice vendor library integration
- See the multi-config architecture in action

**Configuration Notes:**
- Update MAC addresses in `Constants.RobotIdentity` with your actual RoboRIO addresses
- Find MAC address: `ip link` on RoboRIO or check admin panel
- Default robot for simulation/unknown hardware is RobotA

Good luck! ðŸ¤–
